## Metadata

Add metadata to MD documents like so:
```
title: My page
author: Mike Dent

```

These must appear at the start of the document and end in the HTML head as meta tags. Stick to letters for the keys.

### Title Tag

The title metadata tag is used to build link text to that file.

## Notes
Does not support old MacOS line endings (`\r`)
