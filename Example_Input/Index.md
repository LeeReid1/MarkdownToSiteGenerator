# The Cat Site

Depending on what you've opened, this is either an markdown file that will be built into a website, or a webpage that came from markdown files. The internet seems to love cats, so this site about cats.

Please note that links and images will appear to not work if you're viewing this in GitHub or on your file system as links assume these files are on a webserver, where '/' points to the site root. When uploaded to a webserver, the html files will all work!

![Picture of a cat. You'll just see this alt text if you're on your filesystem or github. The cat will appear when files are hosted.](cat.jpg)

You can use the menu bar to see pages in this website, or jump straight to the page about cat [history](history).
